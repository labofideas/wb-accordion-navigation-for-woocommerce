# WB Accordion Navigation for WooCommerce - Product Roadmap

## Objective
Turn the plugin from "navigation UI" into a measurable product discovery and conversion tool for WooCommerce stores.

## v1.1 (Free) - Discovery Core
- [x] Modern admin experience (premium layout).
- [x] Native Gutenberg block support.
- [x] Style presets (Minimal, Bold, Glass).
- [x] Live preview in admin settings.
- [x] JSON import/export settings.
- [x] **AJAX filtering mode (initial implementation)** for taxonomy + collection filters.
- [ ] Result count/pagination fragment refresh.
- [ ] URL state sync (`?filters=`) for shareable links and back/forward support.
- [ ] Better empty state controls and loading skeleton.

## v1.2 (Free) - Performance & Compatibility
- [ ] Query optimization for large catalogs (object cache + transient strategy).
- [ ] Theme compatibility pass (Storefront, block themes, common builders).
- [ ] Accessibility hardening (keyboard nav + ARIA announcements for dynamic updates).
- [ ] Analytics baseline: filter clicks and top-used terms.

## Pro Direction
- Rule-based display conditions (page, role, device, product category context).
- Merchandising controls (pin terms/collections, boost priority, schedule seasonal sets).
- Advanced filters (price range, stock, rating, sale percent).
- Behavior analytics dashboard and conversion-assist reporting.
- Smart suggestions (highlight high-converting filters by context).

## Positioning
**WB Product Discovery Navigation for WooCommerce**  
Focus messaging on conversion outcomes, not just accordion UI.
